## Contributing Guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Instachip. It's people like you that make Instachip such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Getting started
Before contributing
You will need to sign a CLA
Passing a system compatibility tests is a prerequisite to contributing
Join our Instachip developers Slack




For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
Create your own fork of the code
Do the changes in your fork
If you like the change and think the project could use it: * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with Procyon Corp. * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct. * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.
For small or "obvious" fixes...
Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
Spelling / grammar fixes
Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
Comment clean up
Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
Adding logging messages or debugging output
Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
Moving source files from one directory or package to another
How to report a bug
Security Disclosure
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.
Any security issues should be submitted directly to something@something.org. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.
Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
Include template for this
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
What version of Instachip are you using (Instachip version)?
What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
What did you do?
What did you expect to see?
What did you see instead? General questions should go to the Instachip general mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The admin there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug
How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Philosophy
Our philosophy is to provide robust tooling to make chip design as intuitive as possible [change as needed].
Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Instachip, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Instachip has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
Code review process
Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the Instachip dev list. Notes are posted to the Instachip Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
